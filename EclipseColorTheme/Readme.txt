I use Eclipse Color Theme (ECT) both to use good looking themes and to create my own theme. Here I am offering configuration files to import my theme named "akin" into Eclipse.
You can install ECT via its update site https://eclipse-color-theme.github.io/update/ or using Eclipse Marketplace. There are some toher plugins such as DevStyle that includes ECT.
